### About

With react native, using redux to control the user's state along with the new cycle to control navigation when connected or disconnected. I used Firebase Auth to create new users with email and password, password recovery and login. React navigation to control routes and navigate them and more.

### Use

In order to run the project, you need a GitHub clone and then a YARN INSTALL to install all the necessary dependencies that will be listed below, also you will need a free project to be able to replace the firebase android credentials, without these credentials the project will not work. They are located at ```android/app/google-services.json```. So, before that you start the project, don't forgot to enable Firebase Auth to email and password on configuration!

Dependencies:

- [x] Redux
- [x] React Redux
- [x] Styled Components
- [x] React Navigation
- [x] Firebase
